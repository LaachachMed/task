- I used Django Framework to create this application for 2 main reasons:
*1st one for the data migration which is very useful to synchronize models with database and that helps us to gain time and avoid complexity.
*2nd one is to create a simple web page using html rendered on python.
- It will be easy also to do that using for the front Angular for showing the data using APIs created with python.


- I hope that I've understand and complete the whole needed tasks.
